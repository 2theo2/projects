					<h1 class="display-2 text-center">Sensory Institute and Your Child's Experience</h1>
					<p>Unwind Sensory Institute was inspired and launched by it's parent company <a href="https://adifferentkindofperfect.net">A Different Kind of Perfect (ADKOP)</a> which servers in a home health capacity. As of 2017, our partners and dedicated therapists decided unanimously that ADKOP Pediatric Therapy needed an on-site facility for outpatient clients where they can come in and experience Unwind Sensory Institute under one roof in a sensory friendly 3,050 square foot building where we could better server out clients.</p>
					<p><span class="blue">Why the passion to bring to bring Sensory Therapy and Outpatient Therapy under one roof?</span> Our facility will not only create an environment where the parent and child can feel the ease of walking into a safe space that is geared for children on all spectrums, they can also untilize one or both resources in one setting and the child has the opportunity to spoeed up the rehabilitation process based on theiry specific therapy plan. We wanted to create a collaborative round table mindset for each child to include the parents and a therapist from the pediatric outpatient therapy side to include

					<p>Unwind Sensory Institute was inspired by licensed therapists with a combined 25+ years of experience in the world of children on all spectrums.</p>
					<p>Over the years as pediatric therapists, we have seen our patients and their families struggle in social situations that chidren typically enjoy. Birthday parites, family gatherings, and amusement parks can become debilitating for those parents struggling with a child that has sensory integrations challenges. Understandably, many families begin to decline invitations altogether, leading to a feeling of isolation for both the child and the parent. Therefore, watching these scenarios unfold led to the create of Unwind Sensory Institute.</p>
					<p>That said, Unwind Sensory Institute's 3,050 square foot facility was created with intentional architechture where the visual and physical traffic flow has been strategially organized for the top pediatric senses (Visual, Auditory, Olfactory/Small, Gustatory/Taste, Tactile/Touch, Proprioceptive and Vestibular) proven to provide wonderful and welcoming sensory feedback to your child.</p>
					<p>Therefore, we have orchestrated a proven sensory methodology that maximizes your child's individual potential with our state of the art <a href="stations.html">Unwind Sensory Stations</a>. Each child will be accompanied with an Unwind Buddy and guided into each unique station targeting all pediatric senses with various physical and mental challenges. The sensory stimulation we have built into each station will provide your child a calming feeling of exporation, freedom, flexibility and thus will facilitate independence in all daily life activities.</p>
					<p>Unwind accommodates children and teens with all abilities, creating a custom sensory expreience that will leave them begging to come back!</p>
